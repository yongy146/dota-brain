  Questions and comments:
    // DayTime
    Is it worth adding it for 0min switch to daytime? -> Recent patch might make it worth it
    I displayed laning tips at -60, -50, -40, -30, 30.
    Tips that are revolving around hero's ulty are being displayed at 8*60.
    Past the laning stage tips at 10*60+10.
    Major item suggestion at 12*60. Usually heroes have the prefered item that they want to buy so this suggestion is effectively for their second major item.
    Checking if enemy heroes is doing Roshan at 15*60+10.
    Should I write heroes name before spells as newer players might not know which hero has that spell? It extends the message.-- Think about this one --
